[Eine Übersicht der Schnellladesäulen ohne Ladeweile / Fast EV Chargers without boredom in Germany](https://www.watbeiwatt.de)

Currently based on data by [Bundesnetzagentur (BNA)](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Sachgebiete/ElektrizitaetundGas/Unternehmen_Institutionen/E-Mobilitaet/KontaktUndWeiteres.html?nn=971862), which seems incomplete and often incorrect until we find a better open data set.

All charging stations are annotated with amenities closeby (within 150m walking distance) that were found using [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openStreetMap.org/). 

Updated occasionally using the fab Github Actions and delivered to the world using Github Pages.
